# FaceReminder Application

FaceReminder is a specialized mobile application designed to help individuals affected by prosopagnosia, a condition that impairs their ability to 
remember faces. The app serves as a helpful tool, enabling users to identify the people around them in different ways. It offers three main methods of 
capturing images: using the device's camera, an external camera, or uploading photos from the device's gallery.
Using a face recognition model, the application can accurately detect faces in the provided images and provide essential information about the 
recognized individuals.
